    Highly recommended. The three of us had a phantastic flight with
    pilot Chris and his team pilots. An extraordinary experience to
    fly towards the Matterhorn and above the Bluelounge while the
    Zermatt unplugged Band played. They can also handle anxious
    Passengers very well, very patient. We will be back next year ðŸª‚

    Thank you Chris &amp; Team (from Google Reviews)
