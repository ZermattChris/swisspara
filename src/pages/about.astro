            Arriving in Zermatt in September of 1981, after a summer of
            touring Europe on his road racing bicycle, to do a day of summer
            skiing... Zermatt quickly became his base to pursue his love of
            skiing. Ski racing, ski instructing &amp; 25 years of orgainising
            ski competitions in Zermatt (Swiss Cups, European Cup, 2x World
            Cups and the infamous 
            <a class="underline text-indigo-900 font-medium" href="http://ski-zermatt.com/mattnet/pics/april2000/BumpBash/index.htm" target="_blank">Triftji Bump Bash</a>) were the focus of his
            younger years.

          <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
            One day in late summer 2006, his future mentor and business
            partner at FlyZermatt, Phil Glutz, pulled him off the stree to be
            a "student" for Phil's final exam to become a Swiss paragliding
            instructor. After a gentle learning curve, Chris got hooked on
            flying, getting into XC (Cross Country - long distance flying) and
            Competitions (even competing for Switzerland in the Paragliding
            World Cup). He's been a Professional Tandem Pilot in Zermatt since 2013.
