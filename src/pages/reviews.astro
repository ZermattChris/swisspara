            As we are a new company, we are just starting to collect our own
            Reviews. That said, Chris has been a Partner at FlyZermatt for 10
            years and has flown thousands of happy customers here in Zermatt
            (you can look as FlyZermatt's Google Reviews for more info).

              Highly recommended. The three of us had a phantastic flight with
              pilot Chris and his team pilots. An extraordinary experience to
              fly towards the Matterhorn and above the Bluelounge while the
              Zermatt unplugged Band played. They can also handle anxious
              Passengers very well, very patient. We will be back next year ðŸª‚
              <br /><br />
              Thank you Chris &amp; Team (from Google Reviews)

              My daughter had a fantastic time flying with Chris. Next time I
              will definitely have to do it myself &nbsp; :-)
